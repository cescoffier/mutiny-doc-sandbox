== Combining items from streams

Combining items from various streams is an essential pattern in Reactive Programming.
It associates the emitted items from multiple streams and emits an _aggregate_. 
The downstream receives this _aggregates_ and can handle it smoothly.

There are plenty of use cases, such as executing two tasks concurrently and waiting for both completions, getting the last items from different streams to build an always up-to-date view, and so on.

=== Combining Unis

Imagine that you have two asynchronous operations to perform like 2 HTTP requests.
You want to send these requests and be notified when both have completed with their responses ready to be consumed.

Of course, you could send the first request, wait for the response, and then send the second request.
If both requests are independent, we can do something better: send both concurrently and await for both completions!

How can you achieve this with Mutiny?

First, each request is a `Uni`, so we have:

[source, java]
----
Uni<Response> uniA = invokeHttpServiceA();
Uni<Response> uniB = invokeHttpServiceB();
----

Then, we want to combine both _responses_:

[source, java]
----
Uni<Tuple2<Response, Response>> responses = Uni.combine()
  .all().unis(uniA, uniB).asTuple();
----

This code creates a new `Uni` produced by combining `uniA` and `uniB`.
The responses are aggregated inside a `Tuple`:

[source, java]
----
Uni.combine().all().unis(uniA, uniB).asTuple()
  .subscribe().with(tuple -> {
    System.out.println("Response from A: " + tuple.getItem1());
    System.out.println("Response from B: " + tuple.getItem2());
  });
----

The `tuple` aggregates the responses in the same order as the `Uni` sequence.

If one of the `Uni` fails, so does the combination and you recieve the failure:

[source, java]
----
Uni.combine().all().unis(uniA, uniB).asTuple()
  .subscribe().with(tuple -> {
    System.out.println("Response from A: " + tuple.getItem1());
    System.out.println("Response from B: " + tuple.getItem2());     
  }, failure -> { ... });
----

Using tuples is convenient but only works if you have less than 10 `Uni` objects.
If you want another structure or deal with more than 10 `Uni` objects then use `combineWith`:

[source, java]
----
Uni<Map<String, Response>> uni = Uni.combine()
  .all().unis(uniA, uniB).combinedWith(
    listOfResponses -> {
      Map<String, Response> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();
      map.put("A", (Response) listOfResponses.get(0));
      map.put("B", (Response) listOfResponses.get(1));
      return map;
    }
  );
----

=== Combining Multis

Combining `Multis` consists of associating items from different stream per _index_:

image::multi-combine.png[Combining Multis, role="center"]

It associates the first items from the combined streams, then the second items:

[source, java]
----
Multi<Tuple<A, B>> combined = Multi.createBy().combining()
  .streams(streamA, streamB).asTuple();
----

As for `Uni`, you can aggregate the item into tuples (up to 9 items) or combine with a combinator function:

[source, java]
----
Multi.createBy().combining()
  .streams(streamA, streamB).using(list -> { ... });
----

If one of the streams fails, the combined stream propagates the failure and stops the emission.
The combined stream completes as soon as one of the observed stream sends the completion event.

NOTE: If one of the observed streams never emits any item then the combined stream will not emit anything.

=== Combining the last items of Multis

It can be useful to combine multiple `Multi` streams and receive the _latest_ items from each stream on every emission:

image::multi-combine-latest.png[Combining Multis to always gets the latest items from every stream, role="center"]

This is achieved using `latest()`:

[source, java]
----
Multi.createBy().combining()
  .streams(streamA, streamB)
  .latestItems().asTuple();

// or

Multi.createBy().combining()
  .streams(streamA, streamB)
  .latestItems().using(list -> { ... });
