== Retrying on failures

It is common to want to retry if something terrible happened.
You can retry upon failure.
The https://quarkus.io/blog/uni-retry/[How does retry... retries] blog post provides a more detailed overview of the retry mechanism.

NOTE: If, despite multiple attempts, it still fails, the failure is propagated downstream.

=== Retry multiple times

To retry on failure, use `onFailure().retry()`:

[source, java]
----
Uni<T> u = uni
  .onFailure().retry().atMost(3);
Multi<T> m = multi
  .onFailure().retry().atMost(3);
----

You pass the number of retries as a parameter.

IMPORTANT: While `.onFailure().retry().indefinitely()` is available, it may never temrinate.
So use it caution.

=== Introduce delays

By default, `retry` retries immediately.
When using remote services, it is often better to delay a bit the attempts.
Mutiny provides a method to configure an exponential backoff: a growing delay between retries.

Configure the exponential backoff as follows:

[source, java]
----
Uni<T> u = uni
  .onFailure().retry()
    .withBackOff(Duration.ofMillis(100), Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .atMost(10);
----

The backoff is configured with the initial and max delay.
Optionally, you can also configure a jitter to add a pinch of randomness to the delay.

When using exponential backoff, you may not want to configure the max number of attempts (`atMost`), but a deadline.
Configure the deadline using `expireIn` or `expireAt`.

=== Deciding to retry

As an alternative to `atMost`, you can also use `until`.
This method accepts a predicate called after every failure. 
If the predicate returned `true,` it retries.
Otherwise, it stops retrying and propagates the last failure downstream:

[source, java]
----
uni
  .onFailure().retry()
    .withBackOff(Duration.ofMillis(100), Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    .until(f -> shouldWeRetry(f));
----
