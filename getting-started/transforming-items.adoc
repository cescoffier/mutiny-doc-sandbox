== Transforming items synchronously

Both `Unis` and `Multis` emit _items_.
One of the most common operations you will do is transforming these items using a synchronous 1-to-1 function.
To achieve this, you use `onItem().transform(Function<T, U>)`.
It calls the passed function for each item and produces the result as an item for its downstream.

=== Transforming items produced by a Uni

Let's imagine you have a `Uni<String>,` and you want to capitalize the received `String.`
Implementing this transformation is done as follows:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Uni<String> u = uni
    .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase());
----

The return `Uni` `u` emits the produced `String.`:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Uni<String> uni = Uni.createFrom().item("hello");
uni
    .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase())    
    .subscribe().with(
        item -> System.out.println(item) // Print HELLO
    ); 
----        

=== Transforming items produced by a Multi

The only difference for `Multi` is that the function may be called multiple times (dependencing on the number of items emitted by the `Multi`):

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Multi<String> m = multi
    .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase());
----

The produced items are passed to the downstream subscriber:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Multi<String> multi = Multi.createFrom().items("a", "b", "c");
multi
        .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase())
        .subscribe().with(
            item -> System.out.println(item) // Print A B C
        ); 
----

=== What if the transformation failed?

If the transformation throws an exception, that exception is caught and passed to the downstream subscriber as a _failure_ event.
It also means that the subscriber won't get any more items after that failure.

=== Chaining multiple transformations

You can, obviously, chain multiple transformations:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Uni<String> u = uni
    .onItem().transform(i -> i.toUpperCase())
    .onItem().transform(i -> i + "!");
----
