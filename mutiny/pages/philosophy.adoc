= Mutiny philosophy and concepts

Mutiny is built on 3 main concepts:

* event-driven - the API makes the event a first-class citizen
* API navigability - based on the previous concept, the API is built around the type of events
* _single_ or _multi_ items streams - Mutiny provides 2 types: `Uni` and `Multi`

== Events

When you use Mutiny you design _assembly lines_ in which events flow.
Events can flow from upstream to downstream (from source to sinks), or some signals can _swim_ upstream from the sinks to the source.

Events going from upstream to downstream are published by `Publisher` and consumed by `Subscriber`, which may produce events for their downstream, as illustrated by the following diagram:

[NOTE]
====
An entity that is both a `Publisher` and a `Subscriber` is generally named a `Processor`.
====

Four types of events can flow in this direction:

* subscribed - indicate that the upstream has taken into account the subscription
* items - events containing some _value_
* completion - event indicating that no more items will be emitted
* failure - event indicating that a failure has been encountered, and no more items will be emitted

`failure` and `completion` are terminal events.
Once they are emitted, no more items are emitted.

Three types of events flow in the opposite direction, _i.e._ from downstream to upstream:

* subscription - event sent by a _subscriber_ to indicate its interest for the events (such as items) emitted by upstream
* requests - event sent by a _subscriber_ indicating how many items event it is able to handle
* cancellation - event sent by a _subscriber_ to indicate no more events should be emitted

In a typical scenario, a subscriber:

1. A subscriber _subscribes_ to the upstream - the upstream receives the subscription `subscription request`, and when initialized sends the `subscribed` event to the subscriber
2. The subscriber receives the `subscribed` event with a _subscription_ used to emit the `requests` and `cancellation` events
3. The subscriber sends a `request` event indicating how many items it can handle at the moment, it can indicate 1, _n_, or infinite.
4. The publisher receiving the `request` event start emitting at most _n_ item events to the subscriber
5. The subscriber can decide at anytime to request more events, or cancel the subscription

The `request` event is the cornerstone of the back-pressure protocol.
A subscriber should not request more than what it is able to handle, and a publisher should not emit more items than the amount of request received.

[NOTE]
====
The protocol presented in this section is the Reactive Streams protocol.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If no subscriber _subscribes_, no items would be emitted. More importantly, nothing will ever happen.
If you program does not do anything, be sure you subscribed to the flow.

== An event-driven API

Mutiny is an event-driven API.
So for each types of event, there is an `on` associated method that let you handle this specific event.
For example:

.The various types of events
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/EventsTest.java[tags=code]
----

Of course, the methods presented in this snippet are not very interesting, although they are quite useful to trace what's going on.
Mutiny provides many method to transform items, or the streams, compose actions...

The API is composed by _groups_.
For example:

* `multi.onItem()` provides the methods to process item events
* `multi.onFailure()` provides the methods to handle failure and recover
* `multi.transform()` provides the methods to transform the stream such as filtering or selecting items.

== Uni and Multi

Mutiny is based on two types:

* `Multi` - handle stream of _0..*_ items (potentially unbounded)
* `Uni` - handle stream of _0..1_ items

Both `Uni` and `Multi` are asynchronous types.
They receive and fire events, at anytime.

You may wonder why we make this distinction.
`Uni` does not need the complete ceremony presented above as the _request_ does not make a lot of sense.
The `subscribe` event expresses the interest and triggers the computation.
Also, `Uni` can handle items having a `null` value (and has a specific method to handle this case).
`Multi` does not allow it (because the Reactive Streams specification forbids it).

Also, having a `Uni` implementing `Publisher` would be a bit like having `Optional` implementing `Iterable`.

In other words, `Uni`:

* can receive at most 1 `item` event, or a `failure` event
* cannot receive a `completion` event (`null` in the case of 0 item)
* cannot receive a `request` event

The following snippet shows how you can use `Uni` and `Multi`:

.Usage of Uni and Multi
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UniMultiComparisonTest.java[tags=code]
----

You can convert `Unis` to `Multis` and vice-versa:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UniMultiComparisonTest.java[tags=conversion]
----

== Creating and Subscribing to Unis

There are many ways to create instances of `Unis`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UniCreationTest.java[tags=code]
----

Subscribing to `Unis` is done by method provided by `uni.subscribe()`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UniCreationTest.java[tags=subscription]
----

== Creating and Subscribing to Multis

There are many ways to create instances of `Multis`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/MultiCreationTest.java[tags=code]
----

Subscribing to `Multis` is done by method provided by `multi.subscribe()`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/MultiCreationTest.java[tags=subscription]
----

== Structuring the pipeline

It can be hard to structure your sequence of processing in a readable manner.
Mutiny provides the `stage` function to structure your pipeline:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/StageTest.java[tags=code]
----


`stage` can be used on `Multi` and `Uni` and let you group a set of operations in a logical set.
